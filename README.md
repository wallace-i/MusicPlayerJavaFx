## About the program and developer<br>
<p>At roughly ~13500 lines of code and 450+ hours of work, this mp3 player is my first full 
software release and largest project to date. I chose javaFX as the base style to develop 
in after spotting the Media object in my java textbook.

While the textbook called for making a small Video player with a single button I wanted
to use it to create a mp3 player to handle the music on my PC, since after updating
my OS 4 years ago I have been lazy and neglected to re-install iTunes or any other music player.

What started as a music player project quickly developed into a file management system project.
The actual music player and GUI only took a few weeks to put together and work properly. The real
issue of reading, writing, and presenting audio file metadata within the javaFX GUI objects
took about 2/3 of the project development time. I have no experience using winAmp however I
wanted to design this program to be as lightweight, simple, and accessible as possible.

The release of this program is subject to update based on user interest, feedback, and bug reports.
